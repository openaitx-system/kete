//! # kete Core
//!
//! Simulation tools for calculating orbits of comets and asteroids.
//!
//! This is designed to predict of the positions of all known comets and asteroids
//! in the solar system within the next few centuries with high precision.
//!
//! ``kete_core`` is the central mathematical tools, however there is a python wrapper
//! ``kete`` which is intended to be more user friendly.
//!
//! This crate is left as a stand alone Rust crate, completely independent of the
//! Python wrappers. This is done intentionally, as it makes these functions available
//! outside of the python module so that wrappers may be written for other languages
//! later.
//!
//! ## Important Concepts
//!
//! There are a few core concepts which are important to understand.
//!
//! - [`frames::Vector`] - Cartesian vectors in 3D space, typically used to
//!   represent positions and velocities of objects in space.  
//! - [`frames::InertialFrame`] - A coordinate system which defines the
//!   cartesian axis. There are several commonly used coordinate systems, and kete
//!   contains conversion tools between them.
//! - [`state::State`] - The 'state' of an object at an instant of time, which
//!   contains the name, position, velocity, and time of the object.
//! - [`desigs::Desig`] - A designation for an object. There are many ways to
//!   refer to asteroids and comets, this provides representations and tools for
//!   parsing.
//! - [`time::Time`] - Representation of time, and allows conversions between
//!   different time systems. The most common time system used in orbital mechanics
//!   is TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time), however there are many others.
//! - [`fov::FOV`] - A field of view, which is a representation of an
//!   area of sky that a telescope can see. This is used to calculate
//!   whether an object is visible from a given location at a given time.
//! - [`kepler::propagate_two_body`] - If only an approximate position is
//!   required over a short time period, this function can be used as it is about 50x
//!   faster.
